	<p>Electricity in poor countries

Electricity companies are leaving poor people in the dark because they can’t pay the bills, they don’t put clear criteria for sustainable consistent provision. So in fact they are truly leaving country where they don’t have as much client as they need to make a permanent benefit. Sometime people who take these decision should visit the country and the person who live, the condition where they are left. 
Big industry are totally forgetting their project to put electricity in every country of the world, the ugly truth behind this revocation is they have put electricity into country and are now leaving these country afterward people based all their infrastructure, they are left without any chance to get back to a normal life.
The bad idea :
One of the common mistake is to say, if a country need electricity let’s put a nuclear center that will give an amount that are good enough to provide anyone, it’s false. They don’t have the ability to treat the garbage and to maintain the central in a good condition. They won’t be able to afford electricty at the other side of the countries and they will also be expose to irradiation. In the world we try to reach, building a nuclear center or a non-renewable energy center would just be an another backward step for the future.

How can we promote electricity in poor countries ?
Most of these poor countries have big city where all the « rich class » of these populations are regroup, the first step would be to improve the productivity of electricty of these big cities to send electricity through cable to the other small city in the 50 km around.
One of the other solution is that most of their poor countries are in a place of the earth where there is a big sushine rate, that mean there is a lot of space for the solar panel technologies, these panel doesn’t need a lot of equipment to be use, it would be one of the best solution to put a certain number of panel per town that will provide an descent amount of electricty for all these poor people. Except the fact that they don’t need a lost of equipment they also are a renewable energy.
One of the other solution would be to use the excessive amount of steam that they have to put hydroelectric dam, this is a bigger project than the solar panel because it needs a lot more of equipment but, it’s one of the best solution to provide a descent amount for multiple countries. 
This will also require a small amount of cable to afford some city in electricty, but it’s a dust compare to the dam.
How to finance this kind of project ?
We got a lot of investment in renewable energy, we also have a tons of investment for poor countries in way of developpment, we could regroup these investment in a main project to make the new countries the holder of their own energy producing system, and in an another way they would be the first countries in the world to live while using 100% renewable energy.
What’s next ?
The other good fact about this project would be to regroup adjacent poor countries to start a new technological development  program who would be push by the recent access of electricity. With elecricity everything is much easier, building schools, access to healthcare.
