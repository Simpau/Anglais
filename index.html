		<h2>Electricity in poor countries</h2>

			<p class="text-justify">
				Electricity companies are leaving poor people in the dark because they can’t pay the bills, they don’t present clear criteria for sustainable consistent provision. So in fact they are truly leaving countries where they don’t have as much clients as they need to make a continual profit. Sometimes people who take these decisions should visit the country and the people who live there and the conditions they live in. 
				Big industries are totally forgeting their projects to supply electricity all over the world. The ugly truth is that once these companies leave they don’t care about the infrastructure they have left behind.
			</p>
			<h2>The bad idea :</h2>
			<p class="text-justify">
				One of the common mistake is to say, if a country needs electricity we should create  a nuclear centre that would supply that country. This is just not true. These countries don’t have the ability to treat garbage and to maintain a nuclear centre in a good condition. Technically it’s not possible to provide electricity over such a vast space. They may also be exposed to radiation. In the world that we are trying to reach, building a nuclear centre or a non-renewable energy centre would just be an another backward step for the future.
			</p>

			<h2>How can we promote electricity in poor countries ?</h2>
			<p class="text-justify">
				Most of these poor countries have big cities where all the « rich classes » of these populations are in the same areas. The first step would be to improve the productivity of electricty of these big cities to send electricity through cables to the other small cities 50 kms away.
				One of the other solutions is that most poor countries are geographically located south of the equator where there is a lot of sushine . That means there is a lot of space for solar panel technology. These panels don’t need a lot of equipment to be used, it would be one of the best solution to put a certain number of panels per town that would provide a descent amount of electricty for all these poor people. They don’t need a lot of equipment they are also a source of renewable energy.
				One of the other solutions would be to use the excessive amount of steam that they have to install hydroelectric dams, this is a bigger project than the solar panels because it needs a lot more equipment but, it’s one of the best solutions to provide a descent amount for multiple countries. 
				This will also require a small amount of cables to provide some cities with electricty, but it’s  dust in comparaison to the dam.
			</p>
			<h2>How to finance this kind of project ?</h2>
			<p class="text-justify">
			We have a lot of investment in renewable energy, we also have a tons of investment for poor countries in way of development, we could regroup these investments into a main project to make the new countries the holder of their own energy producing system, and in an another way they would be the first countries in the world to live while using 100% renewable energy.
			</p>
			<h2>What’s next ?</h2>
			<p class="text-justify">
				The other good fact about this project would be to regroup adjacent poor countries to start a new technological development  program that would be pushed by the recent access of electricity. With elecricity everything is much easier, building schools, access to healthcare etc. You may agree with us that this is a major problem for their poor countries and we have to react about it until it’s too late.
